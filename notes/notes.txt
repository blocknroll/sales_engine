customer_repo:
# all returns all instances
# random returns a random instance
# find_by_X(match), where X is some attribute, returns a single instance whose X attribute case-insensitive attribute matches the match parameter. For instance, customer_repository.find_by_first_name("Mary") could find a Customer with the first name attribute "Mary" or "mary" but not "Mary Ellen".
# find_all_by_X(match) works just like find_by_X except it returns a collection of all matches. If there is no match, it returns an empty Array

#we need an invoice method that returns an instance of Invoice associated with customer object.

Hey Mr MerchantRepository, what is your merchant_list?


Random test:
- create an empty array and shovel in 100 samples from the item repo
    (you are grabbing 100 samples from all the items that are located
    in the item repo).
- Then run uniq on the sample array, and it will pull out all the values
    that are duplicates.
- probably you will have 10 in there, very likely you'll have 9,
    but it is almost certain that you will have more than 1.
- So that is how you can test if it is returning a random instance.
